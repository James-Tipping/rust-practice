# Generated by Cargo
# ==================
# The compiled crate and all of its dependencies
target/

# In a library crate, the lockfile is generated by docs.rs to document the crate.
# It is not committed to the repository in order to avoid forcing consumers of the
# library to use whatever version of the dependencies the library happened to use
# when the lockfile was generated.
#
# In an application crate, the lockfile should be committed.
