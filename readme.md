# Learning Rust

A personal repo for me to learn Rust.
I am following the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). 
Some code may be mine, and some may be from the book.
Consequently, this repo may be considered to be 
a derived work, and is licensed under the MIT license, which can be found at the top level of the repo.
